## Panel 1: The Midnight Alert - Limitations of Traditional Monitoring

### Scene Description

A dimly lit operations center at 2 AM. A banking support engineer sits hunched over a desk, illuminated by the eerie glow of multiple monitoring dashboards, all showing green status indicators. The atmosphere is heavy with tension as a ringing phone cuts through the silence. The engineer, with furrowed brows and a headset on, alternates between scanning the dashboards and responding to angry customer calls about failed wire transfers.

Below is a conceptual representation of the scene:

+--------------------------------------+
|        Operations Center - 2 AM      |
+--------------------------------------+
| [GREEN] Dashboard 1: System Health   |
| [GREEN] Dashboard 2: Network Status  |

| [GREEN] Dashboard 3: CPU Usage   |
| -------------------------------- |
| Angry Customer Calls             |
| "Why can't I transfer my money?" |
| "Fix this now!"                  |
+--------------------------------------+
|      Engineer: Confusion & Stress    |
|  "Everything looks fine, but it's not"|
+--------------------------------------+

The disconnect between the green dashboards and reality is palpable. Confusion mounts as the illusion of healthy systems clashes with the reality of unhappy customers, setting the stage for a deeper exploration into the limitations of traditional monitoring.
