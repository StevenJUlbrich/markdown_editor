Chaos at Midnight – The Illusion of Green

Illustrate a shadowy, tense operations center at precisely 2:00 AM, bathed in dim, eerie lighting from multiple monitors displaying bright, deceptive green status indicators. Center the scene around three distinct characters, each with speech bubbles capturing their dialogue:

Daniel (anxious, sarcastic): "Everything's green but totally broken! What gives?"

Wanjiru (animated, confused): "Logs are empty—why does it work this way in production?"

Hector Alavaz (calm, authoritative, pointing at tracing dashboard): "Dashboards show metrics, not user experience. Here's the real problem."

In the background, visually indicate ringing phones and a chaotic environment. Daniel appears tense, with earbuds half-in, glancing nervously at screens. Wanjiru urgently gestures toward her sticker-covered laptop. Hector confidently directs attention to a tracing dashboard, prominently displaying anomalies in red, sharply contrasting the deceptive green indicators around them.

The atmosphere should vividly convey chaos transforming into clarity through Hector's guidance, shifting the juniors' confusion to focused determination.
